# Chapter 1: what is management?

We can see author's view on management and what managers do evole through time. 

first level:

- have meetings with reports to help them solve their problems,
- share feedback about what is or isn’t going well, and
- figure out who should be promoted and who should be fired.

next level:

- build a team that works well together,
- support members in reaching their career goals, and
- create processes to get work done smoothly and efficiently.

to one line definition:

get better outcomes from a group of people working together.

Half to look at was team’s results—did we achieve our aspirations in creating valuable, easy-to-use, and well-crafted design work? The other half is based on the strength and satisfaction of my team—did I do a good job hiring and developing individuals, and was my team happy and working well together?
The first criterion looks at our team’s present outcomes; the second criterion asks whether we’re set up for great outcomes in the future.”

purpose, people and process

“The first big part of your job as a manager is to ensure that your team knows what success looks like and cares about achieving it. Getting everyone to understand and believe in your team’s purpose”

“To manage people well, you must develop trusting relationships with them, understand their strengths and weaknesses (as well as your own), make good decisions about who should do what (including hiring and firing when necessary), and coach individuals to do their best.”

“In a team setting, it’s impossible for a group of people to coordinate what needs to get done without spending time on it. The larger the team, the more time is needed. As talented as we are, mind reading is not a core human competency. We need to establish common values within our team for how we make decisions and respond to problems. For managers, important processes to master include running effective meetings, future proofing against past mistakes, planning for tomorrow, and nurturing a healthy culture.”

“Your role as a manager is not to do the work yourself, even if you are the best at it, because that will only take you so far. Your role is to improve the purpose, people, and process of your team to get as high a multiplier effect on your collective outcome as you can.”
