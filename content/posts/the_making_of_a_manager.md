# Chapter 1: what is management?

We can see author's view on management and what managers do evole through time. 

first level:

- have meetings with reports to help them solve their problems,
- share feedback about what is or isn’t going well, and
- figure out who should be promoted and who should be fired.

next level:

- build a team that works well together,
- support members in reaching their career goals, and
- create processes to get work done smoothly and efficiently.

to one line definition:

get better outcomes from a group of people working together.

Half to look at was team’s results—did we achieve our aspirations in creating valuable, easy-to-use, and well-crafted design work? The other half is based on the strength and satisfaction of my team—did I do a good job hiring and developing individuals, and was my team happy and working well together?
The first criterion looks at our team’s present outcomes; the second criterion asks whether we’re set up for great outcomes in the future.”

purpose, people and process

“The first big part of your job as a manager is to ensure that your team knows what success looks like and cares about achieving it. Getting everyone to understand and believe in your team’s purpose”

“To manage people well, you must develop trusting relationships with them, understand their strengths and weaknesses (as well as your own), make good decisions about who should do what (including hiring and firing when necessary), and coach individuals to do their best.”

“In a team setting, it’s impossible for a group of people to coordinate what needs to get done without spending time on it. The larger the team, the more time is needed. As talented as we are, mind reading is not a core human competency. We need to establish common values within our team for how we make decisions and respond to problems. For managers, important processes to master include running effective meetings, future proofing against past mistakes, planning for tomorrow, and nurturing a healthy culture.”

“Your role as a manager is not to do the work yourself, even if you are the best at it, because that will only take you so far. Your role is to improve the purpose, people, and process of your team to get as high a multiplier effect on your collective outcome as you can.”

## leading a small team

everything goes back to *people*

build trust

be human, instead of a boss. respect and care about your report.

invest time to help your support

be honest and transparent, give feedback prompty

## notes
### feedback 
give others timely and useful feedback.

At the same time, as for feedback from your manager, other peers. This is scary because we fear that others will give negative feedback and others will "see through" our imposter syndrome and find we're "fake". 

Ask for both task-specific and behavioral feedback. the more concrete you are about what you want to know, the better. Don't ask question like "how is my speech go?".

Always thank people for feedback. Even if you don't agree with what's said.

### treat manager as coach
see 1:1s with manager as an opportunity for focused learning.

### set aside time to reflect and set goals

1. set goal. e.g. 6 month goal
2. reflect! (retrospective)

### making presentation
send out notes/presentation material beforehand to make people be prepared.

“the curse of knowledge”—the cognitive bias that makes it difficult for them to remember what it’s like to be a beginner seeing the content for the first time. That’s why they assumed the room could quickly grasp all the salient points as they flipped from slide to slide. But if the goal of the meeting is to make decisions or give feedback, it can be tough for stakeholders to understand the material well enough in the span of a single meeting to arrive at thoughtful conclusions.

### good meetings
Have agenda.

A great decision-making meeting does the following: Gets a decision made (obviously) Includes the people most directly affected by the decision as well as a clearly designated decision-maker Presents all credible options objectively and with relevant background information, and includes the team’s recommendation if there is one Gives equal airtime to dissenting opinions and makes people feel that they were heard

In the last few minutes of a meeting, get into the habit of asking, “So before we break, let’s make sure we agree on next steps . . .” 

After the meeting, send out a recap to the attendees with a summary of the discussion, a list of specific action items and who is responsible for each, and when the next check-in will be.

If your meetings tend to be dominated by a few individuals, try mediating the amount of airtime everyone gets. Be on the lookout for interruptions. If someone starts making a point but another loud voice cuts her off, provide cover by saying, “Hang on, Ann wasn’t finished.” As an added bonus, I’ve found that doing this also bolsters your own credibility. 
Similarly, if you see someone seeking to get a word in, you can help create an opening: “John looks like he wants to say something.” My colleague did this for me once in an executive review with twenty other people, and to this day I remember the rush of gratitude I felt.
For the overtalkers, be clear but polite in letting them know that it’s time for someone else to get a turn: “Ian, it’s clear you have more you want to say, but let’s first make sure other people get a chance to weigh in” or “Laura, I’m hearing that you feel very strongly we should do X—before we wrap, does anyone have another opinion? I want to make sure all points of view are heard.”

### Setting goals/milestones for the team
The path to success is never a straight line. It’s not about having the single, brilliant, lightning-flash insight that suddenly wins the game. Instead, it’s about consistent planning and execution—you try what seems like a good idea. You do it quickly. You keep your mind open and curious. You learn. Then you scrap what failed and double down on what’s working. You rinse and repeat, maybe over and over and over again. This process is what makes things happen.

From your target date, work backward and figure out who needs to do what every week. Ask people to set and publicly commit to their weekly goals—this creates accountability. Periodic reviews can also be a good way to sustain momentum. I know a team who uses this technique expertly, sometimes even hosting two meetings a week to review progress and discuss urgent priorities. If
